# BatClassifySharp

  Copyright 2024 Justin A T Halls (jathalls@gmail.com)

  This program is derived from BatClassify by Chris Scott, adapted to use NAudio and FFTW3 under Visual Studio and re-written in C#.
  This version will run as part of Bat Recording Manager, or it can be invoked from the Command Line with a single parameter specifying the file to be analysed.
